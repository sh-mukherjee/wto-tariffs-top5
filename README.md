# 25 Years of Tariffs for the (current) Top 5 GDP Reporting Economies
### **(China, European Union, India, Japan, United States of America)**

I have analysed WTO data on annual simple average MFN tariffs on 22 product categories for the above five reporting economies for 2010 to 2024.

- Which economies have higher tariffs than the others?
- Have tariffs increased or decreased over time?
- Which product categories have higher tariffs than the others?
- Do tariffs vary widely over time, or do they remain at a steady level?
- What are the interesting topics for further analysis?
